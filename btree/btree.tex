\startslide[title={Properties of B-Tree}]
B-trees were invented by Rudolf Bayer and Edward M. McCreight at Boeing Research Labs to efficiently manage
index pages for large random-access files.

According to Knuth's definition, a B-tree of order $m$ is a tree which satisfies the following properties:
\startitemize[n]
\item Every node has at most $m$ children.
\item Every node, except for the root and the leaves, has at least $\lceil m/2\rceil$ children.
\item The root node has at least two children unless it is a leaf.
\item All leaves appear on the same level.
\item A non-leaf node with $k$ children contains $k-1$ keys.
